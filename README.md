# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- a gallary/carousel of images form the coffee shop might be useful to include
- Under the 'about' section, it might be useful to include a contact form so people can contact the coffee shop
- It might be good to have an online shoping page
